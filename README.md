OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT
PROJECT:SIMPLE CALCULATOR
Project Overview:
The goal of this project is to build a basic calculator application that can perform fundamental arithmetic operations. 
This calculator will be implemented using Python, leveraging its built-in functions and basic control flow to handle user inputs and perform calculations.

Key Features:
*Basic Arithmetic Operations: The calculator will support addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*User Input: The program will prompt the user to enter two numbers and select an operation.
*Error Handling: It will include basic error handling to manage invalid inputs (e.g., division by zero) and ensure robustness.
Implementation Steps:
1.Define Functions: Create functions for each arithmetic operation:

*add(a, b)
*subtract(a, b)
*multiply(a, b)
*divide(a, b)
2.Input Handling: Prompt the user to input two numbers and choose an operation. Ensure inputs are validated and converted to the appropriate data types.

3.Perform Calculation: Based on the userâ€™s choice, call the corresponding function and display the result.

4.Error Handling: Implement error checks for invalid operations and handle exceptions (e.g., division by zero).

5.User Interface: Provide a simple text-based interface for user interaction. This can be done using Python's input() function for collecting user inputs.
